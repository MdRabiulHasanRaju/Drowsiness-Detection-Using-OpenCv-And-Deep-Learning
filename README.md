# Drowsiness-Detection-Using-OpenCv-And-Deep-Learning
## My B.Sc. Final Year Research Work

Drivers while driving in a state of drowsiness is one of the most prevalent reasons for the
increasing amount of road accidents and deaths around the globe. Fatigue and distraction, as
well as irresponsible behavior of drivers are major risk factors that cause traffic accidents,
severe injuries, and a high risk of death. Driving a vehicle is complex and requires undivided
attention, lack of attention can be fatal for drivers, pedestrians, and economic activities. Night
driving is more associated with fatigue related accidents than day driving. Our research is
focused on detection of driver drowsiness and irresponsible behavior in real-time using
OpenCV and deep learning methods, whose objective is to alert drivers of their drowsy and
distracted state to avoid road traffic accidents, which will in turn increase transportation safety.
Several facial and body gestures are considered such as indications of drowsiness and fatigue
in drivers, including tiredness in eyes and yawning. These features are an indication that the
driverâ€™s condition is improper. The proposed method demonstrates with the Drowsy Driver
Detection (NTHU-DDD) video dataset of National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan) based on
night vision using infrared camera and State-Farm Distracted Driver Dataset. Our system is
capable of detecting drowsiness in both day and night vision in extremely low light and
challenging conditions with simulated behavior of wearing glasses, sunglasses, non-glasses,
wearing face masks situations. We have successfully implemented deep learning algorithms
with baseline CNN and achieved an accuracy of 89.28% on overall data of NTHU and 96% on
State-Farm Distracted Driver Dataset.
